# Updates

**Standing rule (owner instruction, 1 Oct 2026).** Every change pushed to this repository that an operator has to apply by hand gets a dated entry in this file, in the same commit. That includes a rules publish, a config key, and an app build the phone must install. A code change that cannot go live by itself is unfinished without the entry. The node repository keeps its own steps in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`. Do not put those steps here.

## 5 Oct 2026: confirm your email before signing in; trust score screen rebuilt and shown everywhere

What the app does. An account made with an email and password cannot get into the app until the email is confirmed. Creating an account, signing in with an unconfirmed email, or opening the app with one all land on a "Confirm your email" screen with Resend (once a minute), "I have confirmed" and "Use a different account". Google sign-in is not affected. Forgot password now shows a tap-friendly link and a clear "Check your email" message. The Trust score screen is rebuilt around the node's percentage: the number and tier, how far the next tier is, the five parts with what raises each, and the Learn Hub activity. The percentage now appears on the Home card, the profile, P2P listings and trades, group members, group cards (the group's own percentage), join and payout requests, the people lists and Learn Hub posts. The older on-device score is no longer shown anywhere.

What did not change. The node does not need a new jar. Firestore rules do not change for this.

What you do:

1. Install an app build from this date or later.
2. In the Firebase console, Authentication, Templates, check that "Email address verification" and "Password reset" are enabled and the sender is set. If the reset or confirmation email never arrives, check Authentication, Settings, Authorized domains and the spam folder. The app can only ask Firebase to send them.
3. Accounts that signed up with a password before this build and never confirmed will be asked to confirm on their next open. That is intended.

What this does not do. The check is in the app. A person using a modified app could skip it. To enforce it on the server too, a later change can require `request.auth.token.email_verified == true` for password accounts in `signedIn()` in the Firestore rules; that locks out every unconfirmed account at once, so it is not done here.

## 5 Oct 2026: trust percentage, Learn Hub reads and gifts, group trust

What the app does. A profile and a Learn Hub post show one trust score as a percentage with a tier (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum), read from Firestore. The node computes it and writes it to the person's public card (`PROFILES/{pid}`), so nobody can edit or hide it. Learn Hub posts are social cards: fire, comments, share, gift, a reader that records a verified read once the post is read to the end, and a My Activity screen (30-day bars, popular days, peak hours). A group page shows the group's trust percentage and its five parts. The dynamic-animation library was added so the group list screen no longer crashes when it draws its progress bar. The root Gradle files were restored after CodeAssist removed them, so GitHub Actions can build again.

What did not change. PIN rules, staking, and the 24-hour claim rule.

What you do, in this order:

1. Publish the rules first. Open `docs/firestore.console.rules` in this repository, select all, paste it over the Firebase console editor and publish. Do not copy rules out of a chat message: a chat copy inserts `\` before `$(...)` and the console rejects it. That file now holds the `PIDS` and `PROFILES` rules (the node-only trust fields are read-only for the owner) and the Learn Hub reaction and comment rules. Without them the new app cannot save a profile card, react or comment.
2. The node is already on the matching jar (live since 5 Oct 2026, see the node repository's `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`). Do not restart it for this change.
3. Install an app build from this date or later. Older builds keep working and show the old 0 to 26 score.
4. Clear the GitHub Actions artifact storage (Settings, Actions, Artifacts) so the APK upload step passes. The Gradle build itself passes.
5. Check one profile: open My Activity, read a post to the end, wait for the next node publish and look for the percentage on the profile.

What the app cannot do yet. Several P2P screens still read the older on-device score, and not every other-user profile screen shows the badge. Read receipts are effort evidence, not proof of a person, so engagement is 15% of the score and counts as zero when the reading pattern looks automated.

## 2 Oct 2026 — notices no longer repeat

What the app does. A notice is shown once. The tab already says Notice, so the page does not say it again. A card does not print the same sentence as both the title and the message. A contribution used to write two notices; it now writes one. Copies already saved (the same title and message, or two contribution notices a few minutes apart) are collapsed when the list opens.

What did not change. The node does not need a new jar.

What you do:

1. Install an app build from this commit.
2. Do not restart the live node for this change.

## 2 Oct 2026 — receipt layout for a payment

What the app does. The review before a payment, and the transaction screen after it, now read like a receipt. The amount is large. Under it is what the payment is for, then the date. Transaction details list the status, who it is from, who it is to, and the fee. See more opens the reference, block, and nonce. A timeline shows review, verify, and sent. Verify and continue is what asks for the PIN. On a finished transfer, Share transaction receipt is the button at the bottom.

What did not change. The PIN is still required. The node does not need a new jar.

What you do:

1. Install an app build from this commit.
2. Do not restart the live node for this change.

## 2 Oct 2026 — payment review sheet, then the PIN

What the app does. A payment button no longer opens the PIN by itself. Stake, unstake, claim, send, a group contribution, a deposit, joining, a loan disbursement or repayment, a group-wallet payout, creating a group, and P2P open, release, deposit, listing, and cancel first open a review sheet. The sheet states the amount, what the payment is for, who receives it, where it comes from, and the fee. Verify on that sheet is what asks for the PIN or fingerprint. Cancel on the sheet sends nothing.

What did not change. The PIN is still required, and a phone with no PIN is still sent to Settings. The node does not need a new jar.

What you do:

1. Install an app build from this commit. A build from `7fd6a51` asked for the PIN after a thinner confirm. This build is the receipt the person reads first.
2. Do not restart the live node for this change.

## 1 Oct 2026 — review the payment, then the PIN

What the app does. A payment no longer jumps from the button to the PIN. Stake, unstake, claim, send, a group contribution or deposit, joining a group, a loan disbursement or repayment, a group-wallet payout, creating a group, and P2P open, release, deposit, and listing first show a summary sheet: the amount, who it is for, and the fee. Continue is what asks for the PIN or fingerprint. Cancel on the sheet sends nothing. If no PIN is set, the action still stops and offers Settings.

What did not change. Group creation no longer generates a wallet or a 12-word phrase on the phone. The network assigns the group's wallet (the escrow address) when the group is created, and that address is what the app saves. The old "new group wallet seed" step is gone. Trust and activity are unchanged. The node does not need a new jar.

What you do:

1. Install an app build from this commit.
2. Set a transaction PIN in Settings before the first payment or stake.
3. Do not restart the live node for this change.

## 1 Oct 2026 — payment and staking require a PIN


What the app does. Stake, unstake, claim, send, a group contribution, a loan repayment or disbursement, a group-wallet transfer, creating a group (the fee is taken from the wallet), and P2P claim, release, deposit, and listing no longer go straight through. The screen states the action, then asks for the transaction PIN or fingerprint. If no PIN has been set, the action stops and offers Settings so a PIN can be created. Cancelling sends nothing. Showing the recovery phrase, restoring a wallet, and transferring admin still use the old optional check.

What did not change. The trust number stays 0–26. Activity rows are unchanged. The node does not need a new jar.

What you do:

1. Install an app build from this commit. An older build still lets stake, unstake, and claim through with no check, and still skips the check on other payments when no PIN is set.
2. Set a transaction PIN in Settings before the first payment or stake. Fingerprint works only after that PIN exists and biometric unlock is turned on.
3. Do not restart the live node for this change.

## 1 Oct 2026 — show the node's trust number, not a percent

What the app does. A person's score is the wallet figure the node saved, from 0 to 26 (10 if the device is bound, plus 2 for each active vouch, up to 8). A group's line is the node tier: New circle, Established, or High trust. Home, profile, Discover, your groups, a member sheet, and the P2P screens read that copy in Firestore and fall back to the node. They do not show the old 0–100 profile percent, and profile no longer writes `trust_score` back to `USERS`.

What did not change. Insurance still requires a verified profile, zero reports, and the deposit. Those checks are not the number on screen. The node does not need a new jar for this.

What you do:

1. Install an app build from this commit. A build from `5ce4531` still reads the copies, but several screens still paint the old percent until this build.
2. Do not restart the live node for this change.
3. A wallet or group with no copy yet shows "—" or "Not on the network" until the node publishes one. Opening the group, or a trust event on the wallet, writes the copy. Staking info still refreshes about once a minute.

## 1 Oct 2026 — read trust, groups and staking from the Firestore copy

Commit `5ce4531` on `main`.

What the app does. Group, roster and staking screens read the copy the node wrote. If that document is missing, or Firestore refuses the read, the same call uses the node. No setting changes when the Firebase plan changes. A signed unstake or claim still reads the live action nonce from the node.

What you do:

1. Do not copy rules out of a chat message. A chat copy inserts `\` in front of `$(...)`, and the Firebase console rejects that. Open `docs/firestore.console.rules` in this repository, select all, and paste that over the Firebase console editor. Publish. This works on the free plan. That file is the console rules you pasted on 1 Oct 2026, plus the seven node collections.
2. `docs/firestore.rules` also allows those reads, but its `USERS` rules are stricter than the console. Do not publish that file over the console until the two have been compared.
3. Install an app build from `5ce4531` or later.
4. The copies stay empty until the node is restarted from its own repository, using the steps in that repository's `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` ("Putting a new jar on the live node"). Those steps keep the live config. Do not rebuild the jar from a fresh git checkout and start it on its own: the git properties file is placeholders, and that would blank the guardian keys and the fee wallet. This app update does not restart the node.

The owner published `docs/firestore.console.rules` in the Firebase console on 1 Oct 2026. The node is writing. An installed build from `5ce4531` or later reads the copies and falls back to the node when a copy is missing. An older installed build still calls the node for every screen.
